## bashrc tricks

Editing the bashrc means a great power but a huge responsibility as well.

![](https://i.redd.it/tcso5tdlzy631.png)

Edit the *bash*:

```sh
gedit ~/.bashrc
```

</p></details></br>

Add the *aliases*, *exports*, all the stuff you want, it will allow you free the use of the terminal. Close using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd>, close and reopen. 

## Git stuff

So far you have used git (it is cool, right), but there is a bunch of commands you should try.

### Setting the ssh key
It is the easiest way to interact with you git hub repo. Go to your home folder and generate the SSH key.

```shell
cd ~
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
![](https://i.postimg.cc/4NHshRG0/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-18-47-04.png)

```shell
cd .ssh/
ll
cat id_rsa.pub 
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/7Zg4m1fM/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-18-47-47.png)

Copy the key and then go to your github settings and paste the ssh key.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/TP06XRjK/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-18-55-50.png)

From now you can use the ssh link in your repositories, it is easier, trust me.

If you have any doubts, consider visit this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

### Setting the user and name
In order to link your name and email to git, just run:

```shell
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
Then:

```shell
git config --list
```

## Create your own Github repo

Well, what I am presenting here is just a summary, Git and its use deserve a full course, but I am gonna try to provide the basics (again if you got a job using what you learned here, help me!).

The following example is related to the px_robot repo. So let's start. 

I just created a folder, in this case is a ROS package, so open the terminal and run:

```shell
git init
```
![](https://i.postimg.cc/JhwPtB8s/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-12-36.png)

The check the status:

```shell
git status
```
![](https://i.postimg.cc/sDqJ0ZvT/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-17-31.png)

It should be crying because no files/folders have been added. 

**Tip:** DO NOT ADD THE .VSCODE FOLDER.

Let's add the files.

All files:

```shell
git add .
```

All files except the .vscode folder:
```shell
 git add --all -- ':!/.vscode'
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/x1GbykHJ/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-19-05.png)

There is a more **pro** way using .gitignore, but hey google it.

Run a *git status* to check:

![](https://i.postimg.cc/m2CSJgCR/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-19-16.png)

It is time to make a commit, for God's sake, add a comment.

```shell
git commit -m 'Primera version px_robot'
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/cLWcSGB3/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-20-23.png)

So far you have created a local repo, you can jump between versions, commits, etc. I encourage you to experiment by yourself, Git is useful tool.

Now it is time to create a remote repo, I know it is mainstream but Github is your friend, just go to your Github account and create a new repo. 

**Tip:** Use logical names, in this case the repo's name is the same that the package.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/52f8rqfq/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-20-59.png)

Take note of the repo URL:

![](https://i.postimg.cc/d1csWnYJ/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-30-21.png)

Come back to your local repo and add the remote url.

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:felipeg17/px_robot.git
git remote -v
```
![](https://i.postimg.cc/fR5YQtL4/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-22-11.png)

The repos are linked, now just make a pull (take from the the cloud):

```shell
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories 
```
Merge wit your local repo and that's it.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/5N6hCvhg/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-23-01.png)

![](https://i.postimg.cc/J0dSF4kj/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-22-45.png)

Now push your local repo:

```shell
git push origin master 
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/50srHNpD/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-23-32.png)

Check the internet, and voila:

![](https://i.postimg.cc/qqg52V5q/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-23-47.png)

Just in case check the time line using *git log*:

```shell
git log
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/cC8csszR/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-20-24-05.png)

Now just repeat the process: make changes - add them - make commits - pull the repo - push your changes.

If you are using *vs code*, it determines that you have git, you can use the GUI to make commits and pushes. You must be logged with your git account into *vscode*.

<details><summary>VSCode Style</summary><p>

![](https://i.postimg.cc/CK3Gcy5d/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-19-23-55.png)

Git detects the changes, just add them with the *+*.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/wMHhdhhp/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-19-24-13.png)

Create a commit.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/qBXsx5TM/Screenshot-from-2022-03-29-19-24-29.png)

Push the changes.
</p></details>

**Tip:** Maybe more advanced topics are gonna be covered in the course, but in the case we could not. Check: git branches, git stage, git checkouts.

## Dynamixel packages

Just in case check the [previous class](https://github.com/fegonzalez7/rob_unal_clase3).

Because Matlab is so **freaking useless**, the dynamixel_workbench packages are not added by default. So we have to created them as custom messages.

We need to create a isolated *workspace* with these messages.
```shell
cd 
mkdir -p dyna_ws/src
cd dyna_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/dynamixel-workbench-msgs.git
cd ..
catkin build dynamixel_workbench_msgs 
```

Never source that **ws** for God sake.

Now go to matlab and on the console type:

```matlab
pyenv
```
[![Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/05MfcRkT/Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-10.png)](https://postimg.cc/Sj4CxPzd)

Surely it is not set up properly (**matlab is so dumb**), so type:

```matlab
pyenv('Version','/usr/bin/python2.7')
```
[![Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TYncvVWQ/Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-17.png)](https://postimg.cc/MvKByj5j)

Now it is time to generate the msgs, first get the just compiled dynamixel package, in my case *~/dyna_ws/src/dynamixel-workbench-msgs*, but in your may be different. Go to matlab and type:

```matlab
rosgenmsg('~/dyna_ws/src/dynamixel-workbench-msgs')
```

It takes some time trying to compile, the dumblab ask you to follow some steps, just follow them.

[![Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-25.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3x7F8kXh/Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-18-25.png)](https://postimg.cc/WhWkSbYY)

```matlab
addpath('~/dyna_ws/src/dynamixel-workbench-msgs/matlab_msg_gen_ros1/glnxa64/install/m')
savepath
clear classes
rehash toolboxcache
```

If you get the following, that's fine you got it. Otherwise you are kinda f***ed. 

[![Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-19-39.png](https://i.postimg.cc/R0Z1t2pb/Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-15-19-39.png)](https://postimg.cc/NKZrqCc1)

Seriously I spent more than a day trying to figure out this. [Fajardo](https://github.com/jmfajardod) helped me in the end, but if you guys do not say thanks, donate and leave stars, ....well "no hay palabras...en la buena! :skull_and_crossbones: :skull_and_crossbones:".

**Notice:** join to my research team (:grin:).

**P.D:** It works on Matlab 2020b, I tried in the 2022 and it did not work, if someone managed to make it work, add it here. This is the las semester that we use Matlab.

**P.D 2:** If you have the *pathdef.m* file in a protected folder (error "Unable to save path to file ..."), you have two options:
1. [Activate matlab license](https://la.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/activate-matlab-installation-manually.html) for root user and run matlab with `sudo matlab` (sometimes it generates problems and you must run `xhost +SI:localuser:root`). **Too boring**
1. Search the *pathdef.m* path typing in the MATLAB command window:
    ```matlab
    which pathdef.m
    ```
	![Captura de pantalla de 2022-04-23 13-08-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30636259/164934378-2dfbf971-efb0-4d99-9dcf-85b3fa11a801.png)

    and edit the file manually with a text editor.
    ```sh
	cd <pathdef.m_path>
    sudo gedit pathdef.m
    ```
    add `'~/dyna_ws/src/dynamixel-workbench-msgs/matlab_msg_gen_ros1/glnxa64/install/m:', ...` after the line "%%% BEGIN ENTRIES %%%" and save.

	**Note: Be careful with the syntax, tabs and spaces, MATLAB is fussy.**


## Issues

### cmake
Sometimes dumblab does not detect cmake, so on matlab console run:

```matlab
!cmake --version
```

If you get:

```matlab
cmake: /usr/local/MATLAB/R2020b/bin/glnxa64/libcurl.so.4: no version information available (required by cmake)
cmake: /usr/local/MATLAB/R2020b/sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by cmake)
cmake: /usr/local/MATLAB/R2020b/sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjsoncpp.so.1)
```

I tried a lot of things, edit the path, change dirs, anyway, what finally works:

```sh
cd 
gedit .bashrc
```

In the very last part add:

```sh
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6"
export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so"
```

If you are using zrc just edit its config.

Save, close and rerun matlab, it should have worked. 

[![Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-18-32-11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9FGPg01v/Screenshot-from-2022-04-02-18-32-11.png)](https://postimg.cc/XpYypVR8)

Again last time that we use matlab, it creates more problems than what it solves.

In some cases, at least for Matlab version 2022a, the rosmsg command ask for a 3.9 python version, in this case you have to download the 3.9 version (which is not included in Ubuntu 20.04 by default), and then type the below steps, it will be something as follows:
```matlab
pyenv('Version','/usr/bin/python3.9')
rosgenmsg('~/dyna_ws/src/dynamixel-workbench-msgs')
```
It'll shows an error:

```matlab
Error using ros.internal.createOrGetLocalPython
chmod: cannot access '/home/"usr"/.matlab/R2022a/ros1/glnxa64/venv/bin/activate': No such file or directory


Error in rosgenmsg (line 88)
    ros.internal.createOrGetLocalPython(); %ensure python is available
```
So go at the folder  '/home/"usr"/.matlab/R2022a/ros1/glnxa64/venv' and remove the entire directory; then in terminal type the following command in the respective folder venv:

```sh
sudo apt install python3.9-venv
```
its done you'll have a new python enviroment installed in the 2022a matlab version; so type the rosgenmsg command again and continue with the process.
